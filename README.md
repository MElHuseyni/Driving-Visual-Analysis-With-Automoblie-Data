The dataset, available at http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/epadata/vehicles.csv.zip, contains fuel efficiency performance metrics over time for all makes and models of automobiles in the United States of America. This dataset also contains numerous other features and attributes of the automobile models other than fuel economy, providing an opportunity to summarize and group the data so that we can identify interesting trends and relationships.
